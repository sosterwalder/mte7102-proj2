\noindent{}%
A software architecture for a visual animation system is presented. The system
allows the creation of visually appealing scenes using a graphical user
interface. A node-based graph structure and a sequencer allow compositing and
animating elements such as models or bitmaps. For rendering a highly optimized
algorithm based on ray tracing is used, which allows the rendering of ray
traced scenes in real-time on the GPU.\@ The concept of the node-based graph
structure is demonstrated using a prototype application which allows
compositing a simple scene using primitives and render it in real-time.
